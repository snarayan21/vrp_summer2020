# Truck + Multi-Drone Route Planning
This repository contains code, images, and videos for problems dealing with Truck and Multi-Drone route planning. The first part of the planner uses a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) variant to determine optimal drone routes that start and end on the road to minimize total flight time, and the second part of the planner uses a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) variant to determine the optimal truck route to deploy and collect drones in order to minimize the makespan.
